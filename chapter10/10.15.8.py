# This exercise pertains to the so-called Birthday Paradox, which you can read about at
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox.
# 
# If there are 23 students in your class, what are the chances that two of them have the same
# birthday? You can estimate this probability by generating random samples of 23 birthdays
# and checking for matches. Hint: you can generate random birthdays with the randint
# function in the random module.

# You can download my solution from http://thinkpython2.com/code/birthday.py.
