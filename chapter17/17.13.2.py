17.13.2 Exercise:
'''

# This exercise is a cautionary tale about one of the most common, and difficult to find,
# errors in Python. Write a definition for a class named Kangaroo with the following methods:
#
# 1. An __init__ method that initializes an attribute named pouch_contents to an empty list.
# 2. A method named put_in_pouch that takes an object of any type and adds it to pouch_contents.
# 3. A __str__ method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo object and the
#    contents of the pouch.
#
# Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects, assigning them to variables named kanga and roo,
# and then adding roo to the contents of kangaâ€™s pouch.
#
# Download http://thinkpython2.com/code/BadKangaroo.py. It contains a solution to the previous problem
# with one big, nasty bug. Find and fix the bug.
#
# If you get stuck, you can download http://thinkpython2.com/code/GoodKangaroo.py, which explains the
# problem and demonstrates a solution.
