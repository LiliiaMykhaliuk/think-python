# 1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 Ï€ r3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5? 
radius = 5
print('The volume of a sphere: ', (4/3*math.pi*radius**3))


#2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. 
#   Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy.
#   What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
cover_price = 24.95
discount = 0.4
copies_amount = 60


s_cost_first = 3 #shipping_cost for the first copy
s_cost_add = 0.75 #shipping_cost for each additional copy

#total wholesale cost
sum = (cover_price*discount)*copies_amount + (s_cost_add*(copies_amount-1)) + s_cost_first
print('Total wholesale cost for 60 copies: ', sum)


#3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), 
#   then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, 
#   what time do I get home for breakfast?

#speed (minutes)
easy_pace = '08:15'
tempo = '07:12'

#function convert time from str format('07:12', MM:SS) to amount of seconds
def time_to_seconds(time: str):
     return int(time[:time.find(':')]) * 60 + int(time[time.find(':') +1:])

#convert time to seconds
easy_pace = time_to_seconds(easy_pace)
tempo = time_to_seconds(tempo)

#start time of the run
start_time = datetime.datetime.strptime('6:52','%H:%M')

#calculate duration of the run in seconds (miles*time per mile)
whole_time = (2*easy_pace + 3*tempo)

#calculate time of the end of the run
home_time = (start_time + datetime.timedelta(seconds=whole_time)).time()

print("You will get home at: ",home_time)
